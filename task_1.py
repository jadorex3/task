"""Jack and Daniel are friends. Both of them like letters, especially upper-case ones. They are
cutting upper-case letters from newspapers, and each one of them has his collection of letters
stored in a stack.

One beautiful day, Morgan visited Jack and Daniel. He saw their collections. He wondered what is
the lexicographically minimal string made of those two collections. He can take a letter from a
collection only when it is on the top of the stack. Morgan wants to use all of the letters in
their collections.

As an example, assume Jack has collected a = [A, C, A] and Daniel has b = [B, C, F]. The example
shows the top at index  for each stack of letters. Assembling the string would go as follows:

    Jack    Daniel  result
    ACA     BCF
    CA      BCF	    A
    CA	    CF	    AB
    A	    CF	    ABC
    A	    CF	    ABCA
            F	    ABCAC
                    ABCACF

Note the choice when there was a tie at CA and CF.

Function Description

    Complete the morganAndString function in the editor below. It should return the completed
    string.

    morganAndString has the following parameter(s):

        a: a string representing Jack's letters, top at index 0
        b: a string representing Daniel's letters, top at index 0

Input Format

    The first line contains the an integer t, the number of test cases.

    The next t pairs of lines are as follows:
        - The first line contains string a
        - The second line contains string b.

Constraints

    1 <= T <= 5
    1 <= |a|, |b| <= 10^5
    a and b contain upper-case letters only, ascii[A-Z].

Output Format

    Output the lexicographically minimal string result for each test case in new line.

Sample Input

    2
    JACK
    DANIEL
    ABACABA
    ABACABA

Sample Output

    DAJACKNIEL
    AABABACABACABA

Explanation

    The first letters to choose from were J and D since they were at the top of the stack. D was
    chosen, the options then were J and A. A chosen. Then the two stacks have J and N,
    so J is chosen. (Current string is DAJ) Continuing this way till the end gives us the
    resulting string. """
